Budget 2023-2024

Speech of
Nirmala Sitharaman

Minister of Finance

February 1, 2023

Hon’ble Speaker,

| present the Budget for 2023-24. This is the first Budget in Amrit
Kaal.

Introduction

1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous
Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous
and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and
citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes.

2. In the 75" year of our Independence, the world has recognised the
Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is
estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all
the major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally
caused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right
track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.

3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world
appreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders
who had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our
endeavors going forward.

Resilience amidst multiple crises

4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented
through Sabka Prayas resulting in Jan Bhagidari and targeted support to
those in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global


Page # 6
profile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital
public infrastructure, e.g., Aadhaar, Co-Win and UPI; Covid vaccination drive
in unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as
achieving the climate related goals, mission LIFE, and National Hydrogen
Mission.

5. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed
hungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons
for 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional
security, we are implementing, from 1° January 2023, a scheme to supply
free food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one
year, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire
expenditure of about ~ 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central
Government.

G20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges

6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a
unique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order.
With the theme of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, we are steering an
ambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to
facilitate sustainable economic development.

Achievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind

7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a
better quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more
than doubled to % 1.97 lakh.

8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from
being 10" to 5" largest in the world. We have significantly improved our
position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive
environment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have
made significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.


Page # 7
9. The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the
EPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital
payments of = 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.

10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with
universalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development.
Some of the schemes are:

11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,
ii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,
iii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,
iv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts,

v. Insurance cover for 44.6 crore persons under PM Suraksha
Bima and PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, and

vi. Cash transfer of € 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers
under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.

Vision for Amrit Kaal — an empowered and inclusive economy

11. Our vision for the Amrit Kaal includes technology-driven and
knowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust
financial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka
Prayas is essential.

12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three
things: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the
youth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth
and job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.

13. To service these focus areas in our journey to India@100, we believe
that the following four opportunities can be transformative during Amrit
Kaal.

Economic Empowerment of Women: Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana
National Rural Livelihood Mission has achieved remarkable success
by mobilizing rural women into 81 lakh Self Help Groups. We will
enable these groups to reach the next stage of economic
empowerment through formation of large producer enterprises or
collectives with each having several thousand members and
managed professionally. They will be helped with supply of raw
materials and for better design, quality, branding and marketing of
their products. Through supporting policies, they will be enabled to
scale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as
has been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘Unicorns’.

PM Vishwakarma KAushal Samman (PM VIKAS): For centuries,
traditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands
using tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally
referred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them
represents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a
package of assistance for them has been conceptualized. The new
scheme will enable them to improve the quality, scale and reach of
their products, integrating them with the MSME value chain. The
components of the scheme will include not only financial support
but also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern
digital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand
promotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments,
and social security. This will greatly benefit the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, women and people belonging to the weaker
sections.

Tourism: The country offers immense attraction for domestic as well
as foreign tourists. There is a large potential to be tapped in tourism.
The sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship
for youth in particular. Promotion of tourism will be taken up on
mission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of
government programmes and public-private partnerships.


Page # 9
4) Green Growth: We are implementing many programmes for green
fuel, green energy, green farming, green mobility, green buildings,
and green equipment, and policies for efficient use of energy across
various economic sectors. These green growth efforts help in
reducing carbon intensity of the economy and provides for large-
scale green job opportunities.

(vanchiton ko variyata). There has also been a sustained focus on Jammu &
Kashmir, Ladakh and the North-East. This Budget builds on those efforts.

Agriculture and Cooperation
Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture

| will, now, move to Part B.


Page # 31

PART B

Indirect Taxes

118. My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic
manufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy
and mobility.

119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing
compliance burden and improving tax administration. | propose to reduce
the number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and
agriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic
custom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys,
bicycles, automobiles and naphtha.

Green Mobility

120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, |
propose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained
in it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption
is being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for
manufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles.

Electronics

121. Asa result of various initiatives of the Government, including the
Phased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has
increased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ~ 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to
31 crore units valued at over = 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. To
further deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, |
propose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and
inputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion
cells for batteries for another year.


Page # 32
28

122. Similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, |
propose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV

panels to 2.5 per cent.
Electrical

123. To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing
of electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen
chimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on
heat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per
cent.

Chemicals and Petrochemicals

124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry.
| propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the
Ethanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy
transition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar
from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals
industry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for
use in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5
per cent to 2.5 per cent.

Marine products

125. In the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest
export growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. To
further enhance the export competitiveness of marine products,
particularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic
manufacture of shrimp feed.

Lab Grown Diamonds

126. India is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds,
contributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. With the
depletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards
Lab Grown Diamonds (LGDs) and it holds huge promise. To seize this


Page # 33
29

opportunity, | propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their
manufacture.

Precious Metals

127. Customs Duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were
increased earlier this fiscal. | now propose to increase the duties on articles
made therefrom to enhance the duty differential. | also propose to increase
the import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on
gold and platinum.

Metals

128. To facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector,
exemption from Basic Customs Duty on raw materials for manufacture of
CRGO Steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued.

129. Similarly, the concessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is
also being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for
secondary copper producers who are mainly in the MSME sector.

Compounded Rubber

130. The basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being
increased from 10 per cent to ‘25 per cent or = 30/kg whichever is lower’, at
par with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of
duty.

Cigarettes

131. National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes
was last revised three years ago. This is proposed to be revised upwards by
about 16 per cent.


Page # 34
30

Direct Taxes

132. | now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to
maintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise
various provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the
entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens.

133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department
to improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our
tax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day;
processed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period
reduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;
and 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend
to further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form
for tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance
redressal mechanism.

MSMEs and Professionals

134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy. Micro enterprises with
turnover up to = 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to
& 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. | propose to provide
enhanced limits of ¥ 3 crore and = 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers
whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support
MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, | propose to allow deduction for
expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is
actually made.

Cooperation

135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime
Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the
spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal’, in addition to the
measures proposed in Part A, | have a slew of proposals for the co-operative
sector.


Page # 35
31

136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till
31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is
presently available to new manufacturing companies.

137. Secondly, | propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives
to claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to
assessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them
with a relief of almost € 10,000 crore.

138. Thirdly, | am providing a higher limit of € 2 lakh per member for cash
deposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies
(PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks
(PCARDBs).

139. Similarly, a higher limit of € 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is
being provided to co-operative societies.

Start-Ups

140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. We
have taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results.
India is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks
second in innovation quality among middle-income countries. | propose to
extend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from
31.03.23 to 31.3.24. | further propose to provide the benefit of carry
forward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years
of incorporation to ten years.

Appeals

141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, | propose
to deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals. We
shall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already
received this year.


Page # 36
32

Better targeting of tax concessions

142. For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions,
| propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential
house under sections 54 and 54F to <= 10 crore. Another proposal with
similar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance
policies with very high value.

Rationalisation

143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and
simplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by
statutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of
cities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an
activity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. Other
major measures in this direction are:

e Removing the minimum threshold of % 10,000/- for TDS and
clarifying taxability relating to online gaming;

e Not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice
versa as Capital gain;

e Reducing the TDS rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable
portion of EPF withdrawal in non-PAN cases; and

e Taxation on income from Market Linked Debentures.

Others
144. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following:

e Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT
City till 31.03.2025;

e Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act;

e Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including
that of IDBI Bank; and

e Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund.

Personal Income Tax

145. Now, | come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. |
have five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily
benefit our hard-working middle class.

146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to
= 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. |
propose to increase the rebate limit to = 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus,
persons in the new tax regime, with income up to & 7 lakh will not have to
pay any tax.

147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals.
| had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime
with six income slabs starting from = 2.5 lakh. | propose to change the tax
structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and
increasing the tax exemption limit to < 3 lakh. The new tax rates are:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

= 0-3 lakh Nil

= 3-6 lakh 5 per cent
= 6-9 lakh 10 per cent
= 9-12 lakh 15 per cent
12-15 lakh 20 per cent
Above & 15 lakh 30 per cent

 

 

148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An
individual with an annual income of = 9 lakh will be required to pay only
= 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25
per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, = 60,000/-. Similarly,
an individual with an income of = 15 lakh would be required to pay only
= 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent
from the existing liability of ¥ 1,87,500/.

149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners
including family pensioners, for whom | propose to extend the benefit of


Page # 38
34

standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an
income of = 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ¥ 52,500.

150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the
highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the
highest in the world. | propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37
per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction
of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent.

151. Lastly, the limit of = 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment
on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the
year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was = 30,000/-
pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, | am proposing to
increase this limit to 25 lakh.

152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax
regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the
benefit of the old tax regime.

153. Apart from these, | am also making some other changes as given in
the annexure.

154. Asa result of these proposals, revenue of about < 38,000 crore —
~ 37,000 crore in direct taxes and & 1,000 crore in indirect taxes — will be
forgone while revenue of about < 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized.
Thus, the total revenue forgone is about € 35,000 crore annually.

155. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words, | commend the Budget to this
august House.

Annexure to Part B of the Budget Speech 2023-24

Amendments relating to Direct Taxes

 

A. PROVIDING TAX RELIEF UNDER NEW PERSONAL TAX REGIME

 

 

Al

A.2

A.3

A4

AS

A.6

The new tax regime for Individual and HUF, introduced by the
Finance Act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime.

This regime would also become the default regime for AOP (other
than co-operative), BOI and AJP.

Any individual, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI or AJP not
willing to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed
under the old regime. For those person having income under the
head “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted
for old regime can revoke that option only once and after that
they will continue to be taxed under the new regime. For those
not having income under the head “profit and gains of business or
profession”, option for old regime may be exercised in each year.

Substantial relief is proposed under the new regime with new slabs
and tax rates as under:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Total Income (®) Rate (per cent)
Upto 3,00,000 Nil
From 3,00,001 to 6,00,000 5
From 6,00,001 to 9,00,000 10
From 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15
From 12,00,001 to 15,00,000 20
Above 15,00,000 30

 

 

 

 

Resident individual with total income up to = 5,00,000 do not pay
any tax due to rebate under both old and new regime. It is
proposed to increase the rebate for the resident individual under
the new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is
up to = 7,00,000.

Standard deduction of € 50,000 to salaried individual, and

 

 


Page # 40
36

 

A.7

A.8

deduction from family pension up to € 15,000, is currently allowed
only under the old regime. It is proposed to allow these two
deductions under the new regime also.

Surcharge on income-tax under both old regime and new regime is
10 per cent if income is above = 50 lakh and up to 1 crore, 15 per
cent if income is above %1 crore and up to & 2 crore, 25 per cent if
income is above € 2 crore and up to & 5 crore, and 37 per cent if
income is above % 5 crore. It is proposed that the for those
individuals, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP
under the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the
surcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. Highest surcharge
shall be 25 per cent for income above
® 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7
per cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed
for those who opt to be under the old regime.

Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at
the time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an
employee of the Central Government or State Government), is
exempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the
Income-tax Act (“the Act”) to the extent notified. The maximum
amount which can be exempted is = 3 lakh at present. It is
proposed to issue notification to extend this limit to = 25 lakh.

 

B. SOCIO-ECONOMIC WELFARE MEASURES

 

 

B.1

B.2

Promoting timely payments to Micro and Small Enterprises

In order to promote timely payments to micro and small
enterprises, it is proposed to include payments made to such
enterprises within the ambit of section 43B of the Act. Thus,
deduction for such payments would be allowed only when actually
paid. It will be allowed on accrual basis only if the payment is
within the time mandated under the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act.

Agnipath Scheme, 2022

The payment received from the Agniveer Corpus Fund by the
Agniveers enrolled in Agnipath Scheme, 2022 is proposed to be

made by him or the Central Government to his Seva Nidhi
account.

Relief to sugar co-operatives from past demand

It is proposed that for sugar co-operatives, for years prior to A.Y.
2016-17, if any deduction claimed for expenditure made on
purchase of sugar has been disallowed, an application may be
made to the Assessing Officer, who shall recompute the income of
the relevant previous year after allowing such deduction up to the
price fixed or approved by the Government for such previous year.

Increasing threshold limit for Co-operatives to withdraw cash

without TDS

B.5

B.6

It is proposed to enable co-operatives to withdraw cash up to = 3
crore in a year without being subjected to TDS on such
withdrawal.

Penalty for cash loan/transactions against primary co-operatives
It is proposed to amend section 269SS of the Act to provide that
where a deposit is accepted by a primary agricultural credit
society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural
development bank from its member or a loan is taken from a
primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative
agricultural and rural development bank by its member in cash, no
penal consequence would arise, if the amount of such loan or
deposit in cash is less than < 2 lakh. Further, section 269T of the
Act is proposed to be amended to provide that where a deposit is
repaid by a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-
operative agricultural and rural development bank to its member
or such loan is repaid to a primary agricultural credit society or a
primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank by
its member in cash, no penal consequence shall arise, if the
amount of such loan or deposit in cash is less than € 2 lakh.

Relief to start-ups in carrying forward and setting off of losses

The condition of continuity of at least 51 per cent shareholding for
setting off of carried forward losses is relaxed for an eligible start
up if all the shareholders of the company continue to hold those
shares. At present this relaxation applies for losses incurred during
the period of 7 years from incorporation of such start-up. It is

 

 


Page # 42

B.7

proposed to increase this period to 10 years.

Extension of date of incorporation for eligible start up for

exemption

B.8

B.9

Certain start-ups are eligible for some tax benefit if they are
incorporated before 1st April, 2023. The period of incorporation of
such eligible start-ups is proposed to be extended by one year to
before 1st April, 2024.

Gold to Electronic Gold Receipt

The conversion of physical gold to Electronic Gold Receipt and vice
versa is proposed not to be treated as a transfer and not to attract
any capital gains. This would promote investments in electronic
equivalent of gold.

Incentives to IFSC

Relocation of funds to IFSC has certain tax exemptions, if the
relocation is before 31.03.2023. This date is proposed to be
extended to 31.03.2025. Further, any distributed income from the
offshore derivative instruments entered into with an offshore
banking unit is also proposed to be exempted subject to certain
conditions.

Exemption to development authorities etc.

It is proposed to provide exemption to any income arising to a
body or authority or board or trust or commission, (not being a
company) which has been established or constituted by or under
a Central or State Act with the purposes of satisfying the need for
housing or for planning, development or improvement of cities,
towns and villages or for regulating any activity or matter,
irrespective of whether it is carrying out commercial activity.

Facilitating certain strategic disinvestments

To facilitate certain strategic disinvestments, it is proposed to
allow carry forward of accumulated losses and unabsorbed
depreciation allowance in the case of amalgamation of one or
more banking company with any other banking institution or a
company subsequent to a strategic disinvestment, if such
amalgamation takes place within 5 years of strategic
disinvestment. It is also proposed to modify the definition of
‘strategic disinvestment’.
